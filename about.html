            I live in Portland, Oregon, and am a software engineer who enjoys working with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I'm interested in technology, especially blockchain and decentralized web applications. I also love gaming, music, tacos, and cats.

            My older half-brother sold his first car and bought an Apple II clone in the 1980-something. It had 64k of memory and an amber monochrome screen. My brother and I would write weird programs in BASIC and I learned to navigate and use DOS as an 8 year old. After college I got a job working for Alaska Airlines doing web tech support, then at Microsoft working on usability research, and eventually landed at my first internet startup company (Wetpaint) in 2006.

            I started going deeper into programming and learning the ropes of the startup world from there - initially learning how to query user data from a SQL database, and write simple scripts to automate repetitive work. I don't know why it took me so long, but I dove full time into coding web apps in 2013/2014, fell in love with the Ruby on Rails ecosystem and have been working as a software engineer since then.
