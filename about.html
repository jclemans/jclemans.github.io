        <p>
            I live in Portland, Oregon, and am a software engineer who enjoys working with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I'm interested in technology, especially blockchain and decentralized web applications. I also love gaming, music, tacos, and cats.

            The first computer I used was an Apple II clone in the mid 1980's. It had 64k of memory and an amber monochrome screen. My brother and I would write weird programs in BASIC and I learned to navigate and use DOS when I was 7 or 8. After college I started working for Alaska Airlines doing web tech support, then at Microsoft working on usability research, and eventually landed at my first internet startup company (Wetpaint) in 2006.

        <p>
            I started going deeper into programming and learning the ropes of the startup world from there - initially learning how to query user data from a SQL database, and write simple scripts to automate repetitive work. I dove full time into coding web apps in 2013/2014, fell in love with Ruby on Rails and have been working as a software engineer since then.
